Dradis 2.1 - Release Notes
========================
-- version 2.1 (Easter'09 Release), April 13th, 2009 --
-- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
We are happy to announce that the following new features have made
it into the version 2.1:


1. -- Import from an external source --

The dradis server component now gives you the ability to populate your
notes from an external source through the browser interface. This is
managed by an addition to the server component architecture - import
plugins. Version 2.1 ships with a proof of concept wiki_import plugin 
that allows you to import your vulnerability notes from an external 
MediaWiki source.

With very little effort you can create your own import plugin that is
customised to your specific needs. To assist you in this the framework
provides you with a import plugin generator. Running
'ruby script/generate import_plugin <plugin_name>' in the server
application folder, generates a skeleton in the vendor/plugins folder 
from which you can create your own import plugin. For examples and more
details see dradis community forums at: 

http://dradisframework.org/community/


2. -- Export to an external document format --

To coincide with the import functionality, dradis now also speeds up
your reporting time by exporting to an external document format. This
is also presented to you through the browser interface. As with the
import functionality this is enabled by the addition of export plugins
to the server component architecture. Version 2.1 ships with WordXML
export plugin (checkout the forums for Excel and PDF examples).

You can create you own customised export plugin by using the export
plugin generator. This works in the same fashion as the import plugin.
Running 'ruby script/generate export_plugin <plugin_name> will present
you with a skeleton in the vendor/plugins folder that you can use to
create your own customised export plugin.

For more info on both the import and export plugin generators have a
look at the USAGE files that the generators provides. The following will
also be helpful: [i], [ii]


3. -- Import extension enables NMAP output import --

An extension to the client component now enables you to import NMAP
output in the dradis database. The extension except NMAP output in
either normal, grepable or xml format. For example:

~$ cd dradis-2.1/client/
~/dradis-2.1/client$ ruby dradis.rb
dradis> import nmap /tmp/full_tcp.xml xml

This of course, needs the server to be running and the client 
configuration file (dradis-2.1/client/conf/dradis.xml) being properly 
set.

4. -- Import extension enables text file import --

The same import extension that enables to NMAP import also provides
the ability to import notes from a single text file. This allows you
to import notes gathered from external sources (i.e. nikto) to a dradis 
note.


5. -- More powerful add extension --

The add extension on the client component has been improved. You can
now add notes and categories though the client console
