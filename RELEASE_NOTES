Dradis 2.2 - Release Notes
========================
-- version 2.2, June 11th, 2009 --
-- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
We are happy to announce that the following new features have made
it into the version 2.2:

1. -- wxRuby 2.0.0 on client component --

The component is now compatible with the latest version of wxRuby, 
version 2.0.0.


2. -- Client component RESTfulness --

Some improvements on the REST aspects on the client component side
have been made:
 - better error handling for REST web service communication errors
 - easier REST credentials configuration in ./conf/dradis.xml


3. -- Attachments to nodes --

After long anticipation, attachments can now be added to nodes. This 
is done through the web browser interface. A lot of effort has been 
put into making this as easy to use as possible. To make the management
of attachments as easy and flexible they are stored to the file system
but still referenced in an ActiveRecord-type way. 


4. -- Web browser interface --

- You have asked for refresh buttons - now they are there. You can now 
refresh the tree or the notes panel in the browser view by the click
of a button. 
- The notes grid for IE browsers did not display the columns properly.
This has now been fixed.


5. -- Force webrick --

The dradis server uses webrick instead of mongrel to enable SSL 
communication. A standard Rails application defaults to mongrel if the 
option is available. Dradis has been changed to use webrick even if 
mongrel is available. 


6. -- Server mode --

The dradis server now runs in 'production' mode.
