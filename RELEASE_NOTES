 Dradis Framework 2.4 - Release Notes
=====================================
 -- version 2.4, September 10th, 2009 --
  -- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
We are happy to announce that the following new features have made
it into the version 2.4:

1. -- Plugin feedback
We all have suffered the 'waiting forever' sindrom whenever something went
wrong while using the Upload plugins. We have improved the feedback mechanism
so you will be get useful information about the Upload process.

2. -- Plugin updates
We are now using the Nmap::Parser (http://rubynmap.sourceforge.net/) library in
the Nmap Upload plugin.

A new plugin to query the Open Source Vulnerability Database (OSVDB) has been
added to the set of core plugins deployed with the framework.

3. -- Interface enhancements --
We have added a few elements to the web interface to make the small every day
tasks a bit easier:
  ~ drag'n'drop for notes (so they can be moved across the nodes tree.
  ~ a new *feedback* link has been added to the top-right corner to encourage
    on-the-fly feedback from users finding bugs or requesting features while
    using Dradis.

4. -- Windows installer / Dependencies verification script
Smarter and sexier, the new Windows installer makes use of the official Dradis
icons, and takes even less time to complete the process.

On the Linux front, verify.sh is a shell script that will point you what 
dependencies you need to install in order to get Dradis up and running.
