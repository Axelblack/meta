 Dradis Framework 2.7.2 - Release Notes
=======================================
 -- version 2.7.2, August 1st, 2011 --
  -- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
This is a bug-fixing release (see below).

In 2.7.0 we introduced a lot of new plugins:
* Metasploit import: exploit away with your favourite framework and then import
seamlessly into Dradis to collate results and merge with information from other
tools. Kudos to @sussurro

* NeXpose (.xml), OpenVAS (.xml) and w3af (.xml) output can be uploaded into
Dradis thanks to the amazing work by @raesene

* SureCheck is a great build review tool by Wildcroft Security 
(http://www.wildcroftsecurity.com/) and thanks to @werrett you can now import 
its (.sc) files into Dradis.

* The guys at the Web Exploitation Framework (wXf) team created an upload for 
Dradis.

Some of our good old plugins were updated: 
* Nessus plugin supports .nessus v2 format
* Vuln::DB import plugin updated to work with the latest release (http://securityroots.com/vulndb/)

Along with the changes in the plugin themselves Dradis 2.7.0 introduced the new 
Configuration Manager (browse to /configurations once the server is running).
All the configuration settings for every plugin can be accessed and edited 
through the new config manager. Forget the .yml files and embrace the new web
interface.

We have also improved the command line interface to use Thor. Run: thor -T to 
see all the available tasks for importing, uploading and managing the 
information in your Dradis repository.

Finally we have been working hard on the new Upload Manager, it will let you 
upload *huge* files while keeping you posted of the status of the processing 
that is being done internally. You can see how the plugins are working their 
magic in real time through the new Ajax-enabled interface.
