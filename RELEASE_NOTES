 dradis Framework 2.3 - Release Notes
=====================================
 -- version 2.3, August 1st, 2009 --
  -- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
We are happy to announce that the following new features have made
it into the version 2.3:

1. -- New component: the Meta-Server -- 
A central project repository to hold all your projects, for future reference and
for backup purposes.

The idea is to have the project management functions into a separate components
so we can grow each component to better solve the problem they are trying to 
solve and not clutter one component with functionality that should have been 
provided in other.

2. -- New plugin category: upload plugins --
Import into dradis the contents of any file. We already have implementations 
that let you upload Nmap and Nessus results.

Even a plugin generator is also provided so you can create your own upload 
plugins:

$ ./script/generate upload_plugin nikto_upload

More information on plugins is available at:
  http://dradisframework.org/server_plugins.html

3. -- New client-side extensions: Qualys and Nessus --
We had the Nmap import extension, two new modules let you include Nessus and 
Qualys results from the console client.

4. -- Better Word reports --
There is no excuse not to use the WordExport plugin now. You can generate your
templates starting from any existing Word document and you will not need to 
edit the XML code. Just using Word you can have your template running in a few
minutes.

To explain everything better, we have put together a tutorial on using the 
plugin at:
  http://dradisframework.org/WordExport_templates.html

5. -- Project Management --
It is possible to export your current project into a file in the file system to
import it back at a later point.

You can choose to export the contents of the database only or also include the
attachments. Think about the implications, you can create a set of nodes and 
notes that represent what you would normally do when testing 'web applications'
save that set as a 'template' and use it from now on every time you need to 
test a web application.

Of course you can store you project into the Meta-Server and check out existing
projects from it.

6. -- Interface enhancements --
We have added a few elements to the web interface to make the small every day
tasks a bit easier. There is a new node filter in the tree that you can use to
hide the nodes you are not interested in. There are other 'quick action' 
buttons that let you expand/collapse/refresh the tree.

We have also added a new button in the status bar that would present you with
the latest feaures included in the current version of the framework so you can
quickly learn how to make the most of the available functionality.
