 Dradis Framework 2.8 - Release Notes
=======================================
 -- version 2.8, October 10th, 2011 --
  -- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
This version introduces two major updates: three-column layout and smart ajax
updates.

We always try to improve the interface and UX for our users. With this realease
we are introducing a cleaner three-column layout that maximizes the amount of
space available to view your notes and removes the clutter in the note list.

Read more about the three-column layout here:

Knowing that there is a new revision in the server and that we should update is
a good way to learn that others in the team are making changes, however the new
smart updates will bring any changes made by your team mates to your current
session without having to hit refresh or take any other action. Automagic!

A screencast showing the smart ajax updates in action can be found here:
http://blog.dradisframework.org/2011/09/new-in-dradis-28-smart-refresh.html

In addition to the above, we have worked on an improved version of the Nmap and
Nessus upload plugins to re-use existing host nodes and thus avoid duplication.
