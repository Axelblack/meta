 Dradis Framework 2.6 - Release Notes
=====================================
 -- version 2.6, Nov 30th, 2010 --
  -- http://dradisframework.org --

What is new
-----------
This is a performance improvement release.

Some issues were spoted in the latest 2.5 branch where users accessing a remote
Dradis server would experience performance degradation.

We have done a few things:
* Upgraded from Rails 2 to Rails 3
* Upgraded ExtJS (our GUI library) to the latest version available: 3.3
* Perform asset catching to speed up response

With all these improvements Dradis now earns a Grade B on YSlow when running
in production mode.

Apart from improving the overall performance we have also added some new 
content to help first-time users learn to use the interface and how to format
notes.
